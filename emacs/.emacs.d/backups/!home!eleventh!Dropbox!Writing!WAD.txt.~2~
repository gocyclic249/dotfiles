[fieldset=Background]
Bjorn was born to the Bear-Claw tribe deep in the snow capped northern mountains. Years prior a white dragon had traveled and intermarried with the tribe leaving more than one legacy. Like most born to the dragon's line  Bjorn could not weild the sacred bear toten of the tribes warriors  but instead called in the icy berzerk rage of his ancestor.
Years of raids against both giant and man hardened the young Bjorn. After a particularly successful raid, in the battle dew covered snow he earned the name Jötunn-bane.

[fieldset=Description]
Living up to his title of Berserk, Bjorn disdains to wear armor or indeed even a shirt even in the coldest weather. This showes off his chest and arm tatoos. A roaring bear tatooed over his heart and runescript showing his kills and honoring the gods covering both his arms along with his chest.
