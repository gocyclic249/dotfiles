	abstract = {When assessing dangerousness of mentally ill persons with the objective of making a decision on civil commitment, medical and legal experts use information typically belonging to their professional frame of reference. This is investigated in two studies of the commitment decision. It is hypothesized that an ‘expertise bias’ may explain differences between the medical and the legal expert in defining the dangerousness concept (study 1), and in assessing the seriousness of the danger (study 2). Judges define dangerousness more often as harming others, whereas psychiatrists more often include harm to self in the definition. In assessing the seriousness of the danger, experts tend to be more tolerant with regard to false negatives, as the type of behavior is more familiar to them. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The {CATS} project was established to deliver evidence-based cognitive-behavioral trauma treatments for children and adolescents affected by the September 11 terrorist attack in New York City and to examine implementation processes and outcomes associated with delivery of these treatments. Referrals were obtained on 1,764 children and adolescents; of these, 1,387 were subsequently assessed with a standardized clinical battery and 704 found to be eligible for services. Ultimately 700 youth participated in the project. Treatments were delivered in either school or clinic settings by clinicians employed in 9 provider organizations in New York City. All participating clinicians were trained on the cognitive behavioral therapy models by the treatment developers and received case consultation for 18 months by expert clinician consultants and the treatment developers. The challenges of mounting a large trauma treatment project within routine clinical practices in the aftermath of a disaster and simultaneously evaluating the project have been significant. We outline the major challenges, describe strategies we employed to address them, and make recommendations based on critical lessons learned.;},

	abstract = {Distressing health promotion advertising involves the elicitation of negative emotion to increase the likelihood that health messages will stimulate audience members to adopt healthier behaviors. Irrespective of its effectiveness, distressing advertising risks harming audience members who do not consent to the intervention and are unable to withdraw from it. Further, the use of these approaches may increase the potential for unfairness or stigmatization toward those targeted, or be considered unacceptable by some sections of the public. We acknowledge and discuss these concerns, but, using the public health ethics literature as a guide, argue that distressing advertising can be ethically defensible if conditions of effectiveness, proportionality necessity, least infringement, and public accountability are satisfied. We do not take a broad view as to whether distressing advertising is ethical or unethical, because we see the evidence for both the effectiveness of distressing approaches and their potential to generate iatrogenic effects to be inconclusive. However, we believe it possible to use the current evidence base to make informed estimates of the likely consequences of specific message presentations. Messages can be pre-tested and monitored to identify and deal with potential problems. We discuss how advertisers can approach the problems of deciding on the appropriate intensity of ethical review, and evaluating prospective distressing advertising campaigns against the conditions outlined. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}},

	abstract = {Background
Suicide prevention in the clinical setting is focused on evaluating risk in the coming hours to days, yet little is known about which factors increase acute risk.
Purpose
To determine the prevalence of factors that may serve as warnings of heightened acute risk.
Methods
Veterans attending an urgent care psychiatric clinic (n=473) completed a survey on suicidal ideation and other acute risk warning signs.
Results
More than half the sample (52\%) reported suicidal ideation during the prior week. Of these, more than one-third (37\%) had active ideation which included participants with a current suicide plan (27\%) and those who had made preparations to carry out their plan (12\%). Other warning signs were also highly prevalent, with the most common being: sleep disturbances (89\%), intense anxiety (76\%), intense agitation (75\%), hopelessness (70\%), and desperation (70\%). Almost all participants (97\%) endorsed at least one warning sign. Participants with depressive syndrome and/or who screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder endorsed the largest number of warning signs. Those with both depressive syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder were more likely to endorse intense affective states than those with either disorder alone. All p-values for group comparisons are {\textless}.008.
Conclusion
Our major findings are the strikingly high prevalence of past suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, current suicidal ideation and intense affective states in veterans attending an urgent care psychiatric clinic; and the strong associations between co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive syndrome with intense affective states.},

	abstract = {One topic that has had considerable attention is online counselling, also known as e-therapy or telepsychology (e.g., Barnett \& Scheetz, 2003; Kanani \& Regehr, 2003; Marks \& Cavanagh, 2009; Rummell \& Joyce, 2010). However, many other topics can be found, such as computerized online test scoring services (Fisher \& Fried, 2003), e-mail teleconsultations (Bergus, Emerson, Reed, \& Attaluri, 2006; Car \& Sheikh, 2004), searching online for client information (i.e., "Googling your client"; Clinton, Silverman, \& Brendel, 2010), online client discussion groups (Humphreys, Winzelberg, \& Klaw, 2000), the use of online psychological assessments (Butcher, Perry, \& Hahn, 2004; Naglieri et al., 2004), the management of negative reviews published online through provider-rating sites (Luo \& Smith, 201 1), e-mail communications with clients (Gutheil \& Simon, 2005; Kassaw \& Gabbard, 2002), electronic health records (Iacovino, 2004; Jain \& Roberts, 2009; {McSherry}, 2004; Richards, 2009), cross-border regulatory considerations (Koocher \& Murray, 2000; Smith, 2010), online test sales and auctions (Lobello \& Zachar, 2007), the need to educate the public about the uneven quality of online health information (Goldner, 2006), online reimbursement and billing (Maheu, 2003; Ragusea \& {VandenCreek}, 2003), client blogs (Tunick \& Mednick, 2009), and online threats to test security ({CPA}, 2009; Ruiz, Drake, Glass, Marcotte \& van Gorp, 2002).
One of the more unique dilemmas relating to online social networking sites are the potential for a client to request to be a "friend" of the psychologist on such a site. Such "friending" of clients (which has a different definition for online "friend" than might be used in other interactions) would result in crossing traditional psychotherapy boundaries and change the frame of reference for the professional relationship (Luo, 2009). Even if one does not accept the "friend request" from a client, it does not stop the client from potentially having mutual "friends" on a social networking site. If this happens, the mutual friend may, for example, have photos of the psychologist on his or her website that are tagged with the names of the people in the photos. In fact, new photo equipment routinely "{GeoTag}" such photos when they were taken, giving exact {GPS} coordinates. Such "{GeoTagging}" allows information on the exact location of where the photo was taken to be a part of the photo's information and can be easily obtained by downloading the photo. In this and other ways, being a social network "friend of a friend" can lead to unintended and unwanted self-disclosures of personal information (e.g., where the psychologist lives).},

	abstract = {Depression is the leading cause of disease-related disability in women. Epidemiological studies have shown that the lifetime prevalence of a major depressive disorder in women (21.3\%) is almost twice that in men (12.7\%). This ratio has been documented in different countries and ethnic groups. Sex differences relating to depression vary with age, with male and female children showing similar incidence rates. National comorbidity data reveal that sex differences in prevalence first appear around the age of 10 years and persist until midlife, after which they disappear. Therefore, women have the greatest risk for developing depressive disorders during their child-bearing years. Several biological processes are thought to be involved in the predisposition of women to depression, including genetically determined vulnerability, hormonal fluctuations related to various aspects of reproductive function, and an undue sensitivity to such hormonal fluctuations in brain systems that mediate depressive states. Psychosocial events such as role-stress, victimization, sex-specific socialization, internalization coping style, and disadvantaged social status have all been considered to be contributors to the increased vulnerability of women to depression. Women are more susceptible than men to stress-induced depression and to changes in photoperiod (more than 80\% of individuals with seasonal affective disorder are women). Depression in women may develop during different phases of the reproductive cycle (premenstrual dysphoric disorder, depression during pregnancy, postpartum depressive conditions, and menopausal depression). Other reproductive events such as infertility, miscarriage, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement treatment have been reported to cause depression in women.},

	abstract = {Many military personnel with mental health problems do not seek treatment from mental health professionals, and if they do seek treatment, they drop out of treatment before receiving the recommended number of sessions. The present study examined the role of 4 different stigma perceptions on these outcomes: perceived stigma to career, perceived stigma of differential treatment, self-stigma from seeking treatment, and stigmatizing perceptions of soldiers who seek treatment. One thousand three hundred twenty-four active duty soldiers completed a self-report survey assessment that included measures of the 4 different stigma perceptions, indices of mental health symptoms, receipt of mental health treatment, and whether they had dropped out of treatment before it was completed. Participants screening positive for a mental health problem reported higher scores on all 4 stigma perceptions. All 4 stigma perceptions were each associated with a reduced likelihood of treatment seeking when considered individually, but only stigmatizing beliefs about those who seek treatment were uniquely associated with treatment seeking. Perceived stigma for one's career and differential treatment from others, along with self-stigma from treatment seeking, were associated with an increased probability of dropping out of mental health treatment. Self-stigma from treatment seeking was the only unique predictor of dropout. Different stigma perceptions were associated with treatment seeking and dropout. Further longitudinal research is needed to examine how stigma perceptions influence these important outcomes. Practitioners need to be aware of how different stigma perceptions can influence treatment seeking and potentially target stigma perceptions during treatment to prevent dropout.},

	abstract = {The goal of this book is to sensitize readers to a wide range of ethical issues in the practice of counseling and psychotherapy and to provide them with resources upon which they can rely to help them deal responsibly with such issues. The book uses the codes of ethics and guidelines of the major professional associations (American Counseling Association, American Psychological Association, and the American School Counselor Association) to familiarize readers with the fundamental standards for responsible practice, and also includes analysis of the writings of ethics scholars and citations of relevant research. Ethics codes alone do not answer many ethical questions practitioners face, but the writings of scholars and the relevant research can help them respond appropriately to complex and confusing ethical issues not directly discussed in the code. The book also presents a 10-stage model of ethical decision making and shows its application to a variety of ethical dilemmas. The aim of this model is to guide readers through complex dilemmas in a systematic way. Coping with ethical issues in practice can be an intense, emotional experience. The availability of a systematic model for analyzing ethical issues helps practitioners make decisions that are reasoned and client-centered even when they feel strong emotions. Numerous cases for discussion are also offered, many of which include extensive analysis using the codes and related literature. Another major goal of the book is to devote comprehensive attention to major ethical issues that confront practitioners--such as confidentiality, informed consent, dual relationships, and competence to practice--and the ethical issues that practitioners experience in special settings. Lastly, the book aims to help readers understand the philosophical and historical underpinnings of current ethical standards and to tie ethical standards to important legal rulings and statutes.

	abstract = {Instead of waiting for the {FTC} to file a complaint, the {APA} Ethics Committee decided to make revisions to its Ethical Priciples of Psychologists and Code of Conduct to accommodate the {FTC}'s stance. Between 1977 and 1981, changes were made to the code ([Koocher], 1994). After the 1981 code was adopted, the {FTC} began investigating the {APA} and received complaints from individuals who had been subjected to enforcement under the code. Subsequently, in response to {FTC} threats, the {APA} Board of Directors declared an "emergency" and amended the code in 1989. The code was once again modified in 1992 and reviewed by the {FTC} before its adoption. In 1989, the {APA} rescinded principles that prevented: 1) claims of unusual, unique, or one-of-a-kind abilities, 2) the use of testimonials from patients, 3) the use of statements appealing to a client's fear and anxiety if services are not obtained, 4) claims of the comparative desirability of one service over another, and 5) direct solicitation of individual clients (Koocher, 1994). In 1992, the only principles to be reinstated were the prevention of direct solicitation of individual clients and the prevention of testimonials from current clients (although psychologists are allowed to use testimonials from former clients that are not subject to "undue influence"). [Frisch] and [Reberg] (1991) note that psychologists have historically refrained from using self-advertising strategies out of "custom, etiquette, and self-esteem" (p. 176). The standard practice for psychologists was also to limit any advertisements to a single public announcement in the newspaper announcing the availability of services (Frisch \& Reberg, 1991; Koocher, 1994).
Public claims about the effectiveness of an intervention should never use terms such as "guaranteed" and "miracle cure" or even imply perfect results. Nonetheless, out of the two statements cited by Miller above, the former statement appears to be the lesser of the two evils and could actually qualify as an appropriate public claim if the extreme language was eliminated. There is an important distinction between these two statements. The latter statement simply makes an outrageous claim about the effectiveness of the treatment. The former statement describes the unique aspects of the treatment that are purported to be responsible for its effectiveness, which is ethically acceptable and should be encouraged. To elaborate, the former statement makes the claim that the treatment "empowers those in recovery to find the source of their recovery within themselves, rather than remaining dependent." By qualifying this statement to read, "attempts" to empower those in recovery to try to find the source of their recovery...," the publishers would be providing valuable information to potential consumers of the book. This description might appeal to an individual who has been struggling with an addiction and has found other treatments, such as psychopharmacological treatments or behavioural therapy, to be too directive. The description of a client-centred approach may sound more appealing and instill more confidence to pursue this type of treatment. On the other hand, if the statement on the book cover had simply read, "New client-centred approach to treating addiction," the consumer may have no idea what is being offered and may remain ignorant of alternative treatments that arc more suited to his or her individual needs. It should be noted that psychologists often have very little control over what appears on a book cover. Although advertising material for books is usually designed by publishers, psychologists should try to encourage accurate and balanced statements made on book covers.
In the Code of Conduct adopted by the College of Psychologists of British Columbia (2003), guidelines in the section "Advertising and other public statemcnts" are relevant to claims of uniqueness and claims of comparative desirability in advertisements. 'Clause 10.14 states that psychologists must present interpretations of "science or the practice of psychology or psychological services to the general public...fairly and accurately." Clause 10.16 (e) also states that a psychologist "must not make false or deceptive statements concerning the scientific or clinical basis for, or results or degree of success of their psychological services." These guidelines are consistent with our arguments in favour of claims of comparative desirability in that they are permissible given they are made honestly and do not contradict scientific evidence. For example, a psychologist who practices cognitive-behavioural therapy would be making a fair and truthful advertising claim in stating that he or she offer a "Scientifically supported method for treating certain forms of depression."},

Aims: To describe the development of a {cCBT} intervention (Think, Feel, Do) for young people, and preliminary outcomes and feedback from a pilot randomized controlled trial. Method: Twenty participants aged 11 to 16 with depression or anxiety were randomized to receive {cCBT} immediately or after a delay. Standardized measures were used to assess self-reported anxiety, depression, self-esteem and cognitions, as well as parent rated strengths and difficulties. A feedback form was also completed to assess young people's views of the programme. Results: A total of 15 participants completed the pre and post assessments in the trial, and 17 provided feedback on the intervention. Paired samples t-tests demonstrated significant improvements on 3 subscales in the control condition, compared to 7 subscales in the {cCBT} condition. Feedback showed moderate to high satisfaction for participants. Conclusions: This study provides encouraging preliminary results for the effectiveness and acceptability of {cCBT} with this age group.

	abstract = {Psychotherapists are taught that when a client expresses resistance repeatedly, they must understand and address its underlying sources. Yet proponents of evidence-based practice ({EBP}) have routinely ignored the root causes of many clinical psychologists' reservations concerning the use of scientific evidence to inform clinical practice. As a consequence, much of the resistance to {EBP} persists, potentially widening the already large scientist–practitioner gap. Following a review of survey data on psychologists' attitudes toward {EBP}, we examine six sources underpinning resistance toward {EBP} in clinical psychology and allied domains: (a) naïve realism, which can lead clinicians to conclude erroneously that client change is due to an intervention itself rather than to a host of competing explanations; (b) deep-seated misconceptions regarding human nature (e.g., mistaken beliefs regarding the causal primacy of early experiences) that can hinder the adoption of evidence-based treatments; (c) statistical misunderstandings regarding the application of group probabilities to individuals; (d) erroneous apportioning of the burden of proof on skeptics rather than proponents of untested therapies; (e) widespread mischaracterizations of what {EBP} entails; and (f) pragmatic, educational, and attitudinal obstacles, such as the discomfort of many practitioners with evaluating the increasingly technical psychotherapy outcome literature. We advance educational proposals for articulating the importance of {EBP} to the forthcoming generation of clinical practitioners and researchers, and constructive remedies for addressing clinical psychologists' objections to {EBP}.},

Although it has been suggested that many military personnel in need of care do not seek services due to concerns with stigma it is not fully clear what role different types of stigma play in the process. Using previously collected data from a clinical sample of 97 military personnel, we conducted path analyses to test the mediation effects of self-stigma on the relationship between public stigma and attitudes toward and intentions to seek behavioral health care. In contrast to a model of military stigma but in line with research with civilian samples, results from this study indicate that self-stigma fully mediates the relationship between public stigma and help-seeking attitudes and intentions. These results indicate that programming aimed at increasing mental health care use in the military might best focus on reducing self-stigma associated with seeking mental health services.},

Post-deployment difficulties involved troubles relating to others, psychological difficulties, and behavioral or physical problems. Help-seeking barriers included stigma and concerns about the therapy process. Participants’ perspectives on ways to reduce those barriers to seeking help have implications for clinicians’ approach to therapy and outreach with veterans and can inform the development of larger-scale intervention efforts that could be tested through future research.

Risks for the public inherent in this exposure prompted construction of a post-exposure therapeutic intervention for moderating emotional responses. For empirical rigor, efficacy was tested in a laboratory study in which 168 participants were exposed to a terrorism or nonterrorism media clip and for each exposure type to a therapeutic or control intervention. State anxiety and anger were measured before and subsequent to experimental manipulation. The first hypothesis predicting higher post-test anxiety and anger in the terrorism than the nonterrorism exposure group was confirmed, validating the negative effects of exposure. Testing the efficacy of the therapeutic intervention, the second hypothesis predicting, in the terrorism exposure, lower post-test levels of anxiety and anger in the therapeutic than control intervention group was also confirmed. These results support the utility of integrated emotional and cognitive therapeutic intervention. Clinical implications of these results suggest a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for indirect terrorism exposure victims, which is especially important during this new era of terrorism.

More than half (57\%) were skeptical about confidentiality, and more than one-third (35\%) expected parents of children with mental illness to experience self-stigma. Most respondents believed that psychiatric medications affect development (68\%), give children a flat, "zombie"-like affect (53\%), and delay solving "real" behavior-related problems (66\%). Most (86\%) believed that physicians overmedicate children for common behavioral problems. Women and persons with more education rather than less perceived less stigma resulting from treatment but reported more negative views on medication. Beliefs in medication efficacy and trust in physicians were associated with more positive cultural beliefs. {CONCLUSIONS}: Data on the contemporary cultural context surrounding treatment for children's mental health issues revealed substantial stigma concerns, particularly surrounding medication options. These beliefs and attitudes cannot be easily inferred from adults' sociodemographic characteristics. [{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

The vast heterogeneity of terrorism's users is consistent with the “tool” view, affording an analysis of terrorism in terms of means-ends psychology.

	abstract = {Albert Ellis, the renowned creator of one of the most successful forms of psychotherapy - Rational Emotive Therapy ({REBT}) - offers this candid self-assessment, which reveals how he overcame his own emotional and physical challenges using the techniques of {REBT}. Part memoir and part self-help guide, this very personal story traces the struggles that Ellis faced from early childhood to well into his adult life. Whether you are already familiar with Ellis's many best-selling psychology books or are discovering his work for the first time, you will gain many insights into how to deal with your problems by seeing how Ellis learned to cope with his own serious challenges.In his early life, Ellis was faced with a major physical disability, chronic nephritis, or inflammation of his kidneys, which plagued him and led to hospitalization. This experience helped him to develop ways to overcome anxiety. He also suffered from severe migrainelike headaches, which persisted into his forties. Active and energetic by nature, he gradually learned that the best way to cope with any problem, physical or emotional, was to stop "catastrophizing" and to do something to correct it.As Ellis points out in all of his work, when faced with adversity, we had better realize that we have a real choice, either to think rationally or irrationally about the problem. The first option leads to healthy consequences - healthy emotions such as sorrow, regret, frustration, or annoyance, which are justifiable reactions to troubling situations. The second option leads to unhealthy emotions, such as anxiety, depression, rage, and low self-acceptance. When we recognize irrational beliefs as such, we can then use our reason to dispute their inaccuracy. Ellis goes on to describe how these techniques helped him to cope with many other adult emotional problems, including failure in love affairs, shame, anger, distress over his parents' divorce, stress from others' reactions to his atheistic conversations, and upset due to his attitudes about academic and professional setbacks. When he was close to ninety years of age, his rational philosophy helped him cope with a near-fatal illness.Honest and unflinching yet always realistic and forward-looking, Ellis demonstrates how to gain and grow from life's challenges through rational thinking.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety of different doses of {MDMA}-assisted psychotherapy administered in a psychotherapeutic setting to women with chronic {PTSD} secondary to a sexual assault, and also to obtain preliminary data regarding efficacy. Although this study was originally planned to include 29 subjects, political pressures led to the closing of the study before it could be finished, at which time only six subjects had been treated. Preliminary results from those six subjects are presented here. We found that low doses of {MDMA} (between 50 and 75 mg) were both psychologically and physiologically safe for all the subjects. Future studies in larger samples and using larger doses are needed in order to further clarify the safety and efficacy of {MDMA} in the clinical setting in subjects with {PTSD}.

The 164 children were placed into 18 small groups for 10 weekly sessions. The children were screened for traumatic stress symptoms and then randomly divided into experimental and control (wait-list) conditions. All participants completed the measures of the dependent variables (trauma symptoms, anxiety), a social support measure, and group-process measures (group relationships, group cohesion, and catharsis). Results indicated a significantly sharper reduction in trauma symptoms and anxiety in the experimental group than in the control group, regardless of type of trauma. A reduction in anxiety was predicted by gains in social support and group cohesiveness. [{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

	abstract = {Studies aiming to identify if war veterans are at higher risk of suicide have often produced inconsistent results; this could be due to the complexity of comparisons and different methodological approaches. It should be noted that this contingent has many risk factors, such as stressful exposures, wounds, brain trauma and pain syndrome. Most recent observations confirm that veterans are really more likely to die of suicide as compared to the general population; they are also more likely to experience suicidal ideation and suffer from mental health problems. Suicides are more frequent in those who develop {PTSD}, depression and comorbid states due to war exposure. Combat stress and its' frequency may be an important factor leading to suicide within the frame of the stress-vulnerability model. According to this model, the effects of stress may interact with social factors, interpersonal relations and psychological variables producing suicidal tendencies. Modern understanding of stress-vulnerability mechanisms based on genetic predispositions, early life development, level of exposure to stress and stress-reactivity together with interpersonal aspects may help to build more effective suicide prevention programs based on universal/selective/indicated prevention principles.

The psychological responses to war-related stressors are categorized as (1) little or no reaction, (2) acute emotional and behavioral effects, and (3) long-term effects. Specific categories of war-related casualties discussed include refugee status, traumatic bereavement, effects of parental absence, and child soldiers. Psychological responses associated with terrorism and bioterrorism are presented. Lastly, mediators of the psychological response to war-related stressors are discussed, to include exposure effects, gender effects, parental, family and social factors, and child-specific factors. Children exposed to war-related stressors experience a spectrum of psychological morbidities including posttraumatic stress symptomatology, mood disorders, externalizing and disruptive behaviors, and somatic symptoms determined by exposure dose effect. Specific questions for future research are identified.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

Unfortunately, this enthusiasm is often disproportionate to the empirical support for these approaches. However, a new wave of basic, translational, and clinical research has demonstrated that the use of some substances--themselves having little to no therapeutic benefit--may help to increase or potentiate the effectiveness of certain psychological treatments. While these drugs have shown promise in the treatment of other anxiety disorders, they have yet to be thoroughly studied in {PTSD} populations. This article will describe the movement towards the use of pharmacologic substances as adjuncts to psychotherapy and will describe the rationale, initial support, implications, and future directions of their use in the treatment of {PTSD}.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

This article provides an overview of the field and highlights current frameworks for understanding the stages of organizational crisis/response.

	abstract = {While suicide among recently returned veterans is of great concern, it is a relatively rare occurrence within individual hospitals and clinics. Root cause analysis ({RCA}) generates a detailed case report that can be used to identify system-based vulnerabilities following an adverse event. Review of a national database of {RCA} reports may identify common vulnerabilities and assist in the development of more robust prevention strategies. Our objective was to identify and compare common themes among reports of suicide among veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom ({OIF}/{OEF}) in the Veterans Affairs system. Common themes among root causes of suicide as identified in {RCA} reports were collected and compared as the primary outcome-systematic vulnerabilities. Actions recommended within the reports were coded as the secondary outcome-prevention strategies. Fifty-one {RCA} reports of {OIF}/{OEF} suicides were identified by our search. Coding generated 16 common categories among 132 root causes, and 13 categories among 108 recommended actions. Assessment of suicidal risk, coordination of care, timely access to care, and communication among providers were the most common root causes. Actions identified by {RCA} teams to reduce suicide included improving referral processes, staff education in suicide assessment, and follow-up with suicidal veterans. Review of multiple {RCA} reports can identify organizational vulnerabilities detected at the local level that may be applicable system wide. Attention to improving suicide assessment, coordination of care, and timely access may have the largest impact on reducing suicide among {OIF}/{OEF} veterans.},

A special chapter--written by an expert in disaster crisis--uses a case example of the World Trade Center attack to illustrate protocol in this type of situation.Students learn to incorporate assessment into intervention--from the first interview through resolution--using the unique {ABCDE} model-Affective responses, Behavioral responses, Cognitive responses, Developmental assessment, Ecological assessment. Used to evaluate crisis reactions, this model increases the range of the classic {ABC}, to incorporate a developmental-ecological perspective which draws on both developmental and systems theory.},

	abstract = {Objective: Despite concerns regarding elevated psychiatric morbidity and suicide among veterans returning from Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom ({OEF}/{OIF}), little is known about the impact of psychiatric conditions on the risk of suicide in these veterans. To inform tailored suicide prevention efforts, it is important to assess interrelationships between {OEF}/{OIF} status, psychiatric morbidity, and suicide mortality. This study sought to examine potential associations between {OEF}/{OIF} status and suicide mortality among individuals receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, the Veterans Health Administration ({VHA}). Analyses assessed potential interactions between {OEF}/{OIF} status and psychiatric conditions as predictors of suicide. Method: Analyses included data for all individuals who received {VHA} services during fiscal year ({FY}) 2007 or {FY}08 and were alive at the start of {FY}08 (N = 5,772,282). Results: For this cohort, there were 1,920 suicide deaths in {FY}08, including 96 among {OEF}/{OIF} veterans. Controlling for demographic factors, psychiatric conditions, {OEF}/{OIF} status, and the interaction between psychiatric conditions and {OEF}/{OIF} status, no main effects of {OEF}/{OIF} status were observed. However, a significant interaction was found between psychiatric conditions and {OEF}/{OIF} status. Specifically, having a diagnosed mental health condition was associated with a greater risk of suicide among {OEF}/{OIF} veterans (hazard ratio [{HR}] = 4.41; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 2.57, 7.55; p {\textless} .01) than among non-{OEF}/{OIF} veterans ({HR} = 2.48; 95\% {CI} [2.27, 2.71]; p {\textless} .01). Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of mental health screening and intervention for {OEF}/{OIF} veterans.

Over two decades later, this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating {MDMA} as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug (n = 12) or inactive placebo (n = 8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered {PTSD} Scale, administered at baseline, 4 days after each experimental session, and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing, blood pressure, and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up, placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label {MDMA}. Decrease in Clinician-Administered {PTSD} Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received {MDMA} than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83\%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25\%) in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse neurocognitive effects or clinically significant blood pressure increases. {MDMA}-assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm, and it may be useful in patients refractory to other treatments.},

	abstract = {Psychological debriefing ({PD}) is a brief, short-term intervention aimed at mitigating long-term distress and preventing the emergence of posttraumatic stress. In recent years, it has become a ubiquitous intervention, one which has evolved as almost prescriptive following harrowing events and grew through a practical need to offer assistance to those who are exposed to severe trauma. Despite disturbing data from the recent refereed literature of psychology, it is still referred to as the "standard of care" for disaster and crisis response and its use in many quarters continues. This article critically reviews the evidence for and against its use and outlines the weaknesses in the research. The emphasis of this review is on the appropriateness of debriefing in organizations. This article also proposes a set of hypothesized constructs that may, in part, be responsible for the paradoxical effects found in some outcome studies on debriefing. Guidelines are also proposed to help organizations and professionals react appropriately using evidence-based interventions.

Individuals with multiple versus single suicide attempts present a more severe clinical picture and may be at greater risk for suicide. Yet group differences within military samples have been vastly understudied.
Purpose
The objective is to determine demographic, diagnostic, and psychosocial differences, based on suicide attempt status, among military inpatients admitted for suicide-related events.
Method
A retrospective chart review design was used with a total of 423 randomly selected medical records of psychiatric admissions to a military hospital from 2001 to 2006.
Results
Chi-square analyses indicated that individuals with multiple versus single suicide attempts were significantly more likely to have documented childhood sexual abuse (p =.025); problem substance use (p=.001); mood disorder diagnosis (p=.005); substance disorder diagnosis (p =.050); personality disorder not otherwise specified diagnosis (p =.018); and Axis {II} traits or diagnosis (p=.038)when compared to those with a single attempt history. Logistic regression analyses showed that males with multiple suicide attempts were more likely to have problem substance use (p=.005)and a mood disorder diagnosis (p =.002), while females with a multiple attempt history were more likely to have a history of childhood sexual (p =.027).
Discussion
Clinically meaningful differences among military inpatients with single versus multiple suicide attempts exist. Targeted Department of Defense suicide prevention and intervention efforts that address the unique needs of these two specific at-risk subgroups are additionally needed.},

	abstract = {Previous studies indicate that mindfulness interventions and physical activities can produce positive effects on mood disorders; such activities may be options for individuals who search for non-traditional therapies, or whenever mainstream psychological treatments are not effective. We explored the effects of tango dance, meditation, and exercise (circuit training) in individuals with self-reported depression. Participants were randomly placed into meditation, exercise, tango dance, or control-wait-list groups. Sixty-four participants completed the 8-week program and were assessed before, after, and at 1-month follow-up. The dependent variables were depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, and insomnia (symptoms measures), and self-efficacy, satisfaction with life, and mindfulness (positive psychology measures). Treatment scores were compared with the control group scores. The meditation group showed benefits at follow-up for depression, stress, and satisfaction with life. The exercise group showed decreased depression and increased self-efficacy at post-test, but only self-efficacy was persistent at follow-up, whereas stress was just significant at follow-up. The tango group showed decreased depression and insomnia and increased satisfaction with life and mindfulness at post-test. All, except for satisfaction with life, were persistent at follow-up, while stress and anxiety improved only at follow-up. As expected, the control group maintained similar scores across pre-test and post-test, and at follow-up. Tango dance was shown to induce a broader and more persistent range of benefits. Meditation produced lasting benefits only when well-learned and practiced, whereas exercise generated rapid benefits, but, except for self-efficacy, temporary. Such differences may provide valuable information when promoting these activities to best match the individual needs within this population.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

With the stressful turbulence of our present culture, more and more clinicians are called upon to intervene in crisis situations. Violent interactions, once considered rare or beyond the province of the therapist, have become familiar events to many practitioners. This volume provides them with both the theoretical background and practical techniques to help people learn from crisis experiences and move toward change and growth.    Of special interest are practical guidelines and specific intervention strategies for conducting psychotherapy with different types of violent persons and of victims. Treatment principles for each crisis situation are then illustrated in detailed case studies. As the authors demonstrate, with these troubled people a therapist must be ready to make quick decisions, draw upon all available resources from the family and community, and offer continuing support as traumas are worked through and new behavior patterns are learned. In addition, the authors discuss the legal and ethical responsibilities of the therapist.},

Method: The present study surveyed 400 Licensed Clinical Social Workers ({LCSWs}) across the United States in order to determine the extent of their usage of {NUSTs}, as well as their usage of conventional therapies that lacked support and empirically supported therapies ({ESTs}). Reasons for selecting interventions were also assessed. Results: While the vast majority (97.5\%) reported using some form of {EST}, 75\% of our sample also reported using at least one {NUST}. Logistic regression analysis revealed that {NUST} usage was related to female gender and trauma specialization. A split plot {ANOVA} revealed that respondents rated positive clinical experience higher than published research as a reason for selecting an intervention. {LCSWs} with a {CBT} theoretical orientation rated research evidence more highly than those of other theoretical orientations. However, even within the group of {LCSWs} with a {CBT} orientation, clinical experience was rated more highly than research evidence. Conclusions: Implications for practice are discussed.

Evidence regarding the public stigma associated with mental disorders is reviewed, indicating that the public generally holds negative stereotypes toward individuals with psychological problems, leading to potential discrimination toward these individuals. The internalization of these negative beliefs results in self-stigma, leading to reduced self-esteem and motivation to seek help. Even if soldiers form an intention to seek help for their psychological difficulty, barriers to mental health care may prevent the soldier from receiving the help they need. An overall model is proposed to illustrate how the stigma associated with psychological problems can prevent soldiers getting needed help for psychological difficulties and proposed interventions for reducing stigma in a civilian context are considered for military personnel.},

	abstract = {Aims and rationale: The purpose of this study was to review whether methylenedioxymethamphetamine ({MDMA}) has the appropriate pharmacodynamic profile to be a therapeutic agent. Materials and methods: Empirical descriptions of {MDMA}'s subjective effects in humans will be reviewed to evaluate the proposal that {MDMA} has psychotherapeutic properties. The focus will be published evidence on its functional effects in therapeutic, medical, and other situations. Results: {MDMA} is a powerful central nervous system ({CNS}) stimulant which affects several neurotransmitter systems and intensifies a range of psychobiological functions. Its acute mood effects can be very positive and life enhancing, and the affirmative cognitions engendered during {MDMA} therapy may well endure afterwards. However, {MDMA} also has a number of potential anti-therapeutic characteristics. Acutely, it can also intensify negative cognitions, and these may similarly endure over time. Psychotherapists have found that setting, intention, and expectancy are crucial for a positive outcome, but these factors cannot be guaranteed. Post-{MDMA}, there is a period of neurotransmitter recovery when low moods predominate, and these may exacerbate psychiatric distress. The explanations proposed for {MDMA}-assisted therapy are all psychodynamic, and a neurochemical model needs to be outlined. It has been suggested that enduring therapeutic gains can follow a single session, but again, this lacks a clear psychopharmacological rationale. Finally, diathesis-stress models suggest that psychiatric individuals are more prone to acute and chronic abreactions to {CNS} stimulants such as {MDMA}. Conclusions: There are a number of issues which need to be addressed before it can be argued that {MDMA} might be clinically useful for psychotherapy. [{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},
