2017-10-02 15:40:04	Hierophant	In this manner, the approaching deadline (the pressure) motivates me to sit down and invest the 5 hours into completing the task and does not lead to half-assing of the task itself.

2017-10-04 14:53:46	Megafire	This seems a little weird to me, even by RPS standards.
2017-10-04 14:54:22	Aliphant	hm? what's wrong with it?
2017-10-04 14:54:47	Perosa	Aliphant: apparently now the word "gameplay" is a buzzword and it shouldn't be relevant when making games
2017-10-04 14:55:01	Perosa	aka. let's make every game a walking simulator, I guess?
2017-10-04 14:55:10	Aliphant	?!
2017-10-04 14:55:14	Aliphant	I wish there were more walking simulators though
2017-10-04 14:55:33	Aliphant	The only good walking simulator has been so thoroughly demonized and flamed :(
2017-10-04 14:55:37	Aliphant	Okay, there's that music-generated walking simulator whose name starts with a P and escapes me
2017-10-04 14:55:41	Aliphant	but it's just that and NMS
2017-10-04 14:55:58	Perosa	there's more than enough, the point is when they're crusading against games that aren't meant to appeal to them... and demand developers make them appeal to them?
2017-10-04 14:56:01	Perosa	that's ridiculously stupid
2017-10-04 14:56:50	Aliphant	I'll steelman them for a bit and say it's a crusade against the attitude that you need 50 new mechanics every game
2017-10-04 14:57:01	Perosa	no
2017-10-04 14:57:10	Aliphant	And that games like VNs or walking simulators are inherently inferior because they don't involve a billion mechanics 
2017-10-04 14:57:10	Perosa	that's definitely not it
2017-10-04 14:57:11	Perosa	that's most certainly not it
2017-10-04 14:57:44	Perosa	this is "i don't want to play the game, remove boss fights".
2017-10-04 14:59:31	Hex	Walking simulators are, in fact, not video games.
2017-10-04 14:59:46	Hex	They're shitty movies.
2017-10-04 14:59:49	Hex	That fail to evoke any emotion at all in me beyond "Man, I miss King's Quest."
2017-10-04 15:00:13	Hex	Wow look at our shitty puzzle it'll take you two, even THREE minutes to finish it
2017-10-04 15:00:37	Perosa	they lack "gameplay", they're a valid form to tell a story, but I'm not going to accept people who want things to be made easier for them because they're bad at their jobs
2017-10-04 15:01:17	Perosa	"boo-hoo, I couldn't play Cuphead through because I don't get the endings unless I play it in normal mode, let me skip boss fights." what the fuck
2017-10-04 15:01:17	Hex	Also, they're all arguing for it because of the new AC game, which right pisses me off - because the new AC game has an actual interesting mode based around having no gameplay.
2017-10-04 15:01:31	Hex	It's an educational exploration of Ancient Egypt, and Ubisoft actually researches the worlds they design around these games.
2017-10-04 15:01:32	Perosa	learning history mode, right?
2017-10-04 15:02:07	Hex	That's really cool and interesting to do - especially because if people use it, they'll start doing it for other games with less well-known historical backgrounds.
2017-10-04 15:03:18	Perosa	i dig how much work Ubisoft can put into that stuff
2017-10-04 15:03:18	Perosa	but they're two for 200 in good PC ports

2017-10-04 15:04:13	Perosa	i liked Black Flag :(
2017-10-04 15:04:14	Hex	In any case, I find it super fucking funny that the people who say this also want games to be art.
2017-10-04 15:04:33	Perosa	they should've made a pirate action RPG instead of Pyramid Climber
2017-10-04 15:04:35	Hex	Clearly, games can't be art if you don't understand that art sometimes isn't understood by everyone.
2017-10-04 15:04:59	tubes	black flag was great
2017-10-04 15:04:59	tubes	i liked the idea of syndicate

2017-10-04 15:05:18	Hex	I'm pretty sure it's about the Illuminati or something, dude was nuts.
2017-10-04 15:05:58	@Teruzi	I liked the boat fighting
2017-10-04 15:06:10	@Teruzi	Specially the legendary ship fights
2017-10-04 15:06:32	@Teruzi	the one with the two big ass boats at the same time was so good
2017-10-04 15:06:34	Hex	Black Flag is good, but Ubisoft is incredibly good at making bad games.
2017-10-04 15:06:43	Hex	It's impressive.
2017-10-04 15:06:49	Perosa	haha, Hex 
2017-10-04 15:07:17	Perosa	remember when they announced Beyond Good and Evil 2
2017-10-04 15:07:18	Perosa	and said it has seamless drop in multiplayer?
2017-10-04 15:07:18	Hex	I also remember when BGE2 was a prequel.
2017-10-04 15:07:18	Perosa	the cheers turned into silence so fast
2017-10-04 15:07:32	Hex	"We ended this game on a cliffhanger over A DECADE AGO, we should make a prequel to that game."

2017-10-04 16:19:30	Perosa	things to blame: Sony wanting a Ps4-focused competitive shooter? Probably not.
2017-10-04 16:19:47	Perosa	Activision? Likely. Bungie themselves? Less likely.

2017-10-04 16:21:46	Doc_Mod	I also remember Bungie being dead silent on the "ghost bullets" issue. Until like five major streamers started calling them out.

2017-10-04 16:24:45	Doc_Mod	Hey Bungie. Remember Custom Games? That big ass ROI feature?
2017-10-04 16:24:50	Doc_Mod	WHERE IS IT IN D2?
2017-10-04 16:24:55	Hex	It's hiding.
2017-10-04 16:25:03	Perosa	wait for the DLC :^)
2017-10-04 16:25:06	Perosa	do more strikes until then
2017-10-04 16:25:08	Perosa	oh but also
2017-10-04 16:25:13	Perosa	we removed all strike-unique gear
2017-10-04 16:25:21	Hex	Even my cloak of taniks?!
2017-10-04 16:25:23	Perosa	and strikes take 4 times as long as public events for worse loot
2017-10-04 16:25:38	Doc_Mod	Honestly I kind of don't mind that. As I never was one to spend 1,000 strikes grinding for the perfect Imago Loop.
2017-10-04 16:25:46	Doc_Mod	but I can understand the frustration of losing cool unique gear
2017-10-04 16:25:53	Perosa	Hex: yep
2017-10-04 16:25:53	Perosa	it's gone
2017-10-04 16:26:07	Hex	I like strikes.
2017-10-04 16:26:16	Hex	But I'm also an ex-raider.
2017-10-04 16:26:34	Perosa	see the thing is, Doc_Mod 
2017-10-04 16:26:39	Perosa	they removed random perks on loot
2017-10-04 16:26:47	Perosa	but they also have a fraction of the original loot available
2017-10-04 16:26:52	Perosa	and most of it is re-colors 
2017-10-04 16:27:21	Doc_Mod	Yeah. That makes part of the grind pointless. Because Once I get one "StarKiller 9000" I can shard all the others.
2017-10-04 16:28:22	Perosa	exactly the issue lots of people have
2017-10-04 16:28:42	Perosa	they removed unique loot and made the grind useless, but there's not enough loot to actually play a lot without grind
2017-10-04 16:28:59	Perosa	also they made mobility the most useless stat, and hunters the most useless class
2017-10-04 16:29:12	Perosa	because a warlock is faster than hunters
2017-10-04 16:29:23	Doc_Mod	Yeah. I remember people called Hunters selfish until Night stalker
2017-10-04 16:29:32	Doc_Mod	Because Oh my god dat Tether
2017-10-04 16:29:44	Hex	I will be a glorious wizard.

2017-10-04 16:30:54	Perosa	they really need to buff hunters
2017-10-04 16:31:05	Perosa	and make the gear less recolors because shaders are already there to recolor things!
2017-10-04 16:32:08	Doc_Mod	I remember that D1 had lot more loot looks. Even in year 1. Though that could be bias
2017-10-04 16:32:22	Perosa	year 1 didn't have more loot, but less recolors

2017-10-04 16:36:37	Doc_Mod	I am so annoyed at that
2017-10-04 16:36:51	Doc_Mod	Ghaul could have just hooked up a nuke with "Scan for Free exotics" written on it
2017-10-04 16:37:00	Doc_Mod	and he'd kill half our guardians with that alone
2017-10-04 16:37:04	Perosa	hahaha
2017-10-04 16:37:22	Perosa	Cayde does that.
2017-10-04 16:37:45	Perosa	There's a bug... uh, intended feature where a Cayde box spawns near an edge with a super fickle kill volume
2017-10-04 16:37:52	Perosa	so when you open it, it kills you
2017-10-04 16:37:58	Doc_Mod	Lel. 
2017-10-04 16:38:01	Doc_Mod	Oh Cayde
2017-10-04 16:39:07	Doc_Mod	I still don't get why they keep him around. He just irks me. 
2017-10-04 16:39:24	Perosa	he became a meme
2017-10-04 16:40:06	Hex	He's the only named character in the class leaders with any personality.
2017-10-04 16:40:22	Perosa	also he became a meme
2017-10-04 16:41:17	Doc_Mod	He's popular and marketable which means Cayde is invincible. 
2017-10-04 16:41:37	Doc_Mod	and Bungie is tired after working "so" hard on Ikora and Vuvuzela so they'll never get replaced either.
2017-10-04 16:42:50	Perosa	the actual issue is that he hit off with the casual player base and they'll make him the major character of every DLC because they don't have the writers to actually make every character a personality to remember
2017-10-04 16:43:15	Perosa	here's a list of characters people remember in Destiny 2: Ghaul, Cayde, Shaxx. 
2017-10-04 16:43:16	Perosa	that's it
2017-10-04 16:43:43	Perosa	oh also Xur every Friday.
2017-10-04 16:44:00	Hex	Oh, Shaxx.
2017-10-04 16:44:00	Hex	Yeah I remember him because I played a lot of PvP.
2017-10-04 16:44:19	Doc_Mod	"FIGHT FOREEEEVVER GUARDIAN! -feedback squeals-"
2017-10-04 16:45:15	Perosa	and well
2017-10-04 16:45:17	Perosa	they ruined Xur
2017-10-04 16:45:23	Doc_Mod	O rly
2017-10-04 16:45:24	Doc_Mod	How so?
2017-10-04 16:45:30	Doc_Mod	How did they ruin my lovely tentacles.
2017-10-04 16:45:51	Perosa	to quote a Forbes article: "Xur used to sell a number of things besides just exotics, legacy engrams, exotic shards, ammo synths, three of coins weapon ornament bundles, whatever those things were that changed the color of your ship/sparrow trail. Now he has none of that. Eververse has taken over anything remotely cosmetic. The game doesn’t need ammo synths, three of coins or exotic shards anymore (thank god), and that leaves
2017-10-04 16:45:51	Perosa	just…four exotics, every week."
2017-10-04 16:46:59	Doc_Mod	Yeah. I can see why People say D2 is a step forward and a step back.
2017-10-04 16:48:04	Perosa	hyped for Destiny 2 in 2020 being an awesome game, Doc_Mod? :P
2017-10-04 16:48:35	Doc_Mod	Yeah I can't wait for Destiny 2: The Darkness Regent in 2020
2017-10-04 16:48:51	Doc_Mod	Then Destiny 3 goes full circle and is just like Destiny 1 all over again
2017-10-04 16:49:15	Perosa	Destiny 3: Destiny No More
2017-10-04 16:49:26	Doc_Mod	Destiny 3: Make your own game
2017-10-04 16:49:37	Doc_Mod	With micro DLC from eververse
2017-10-04 16:49:52	Doc_Mod	Want a campaign mission? 3.99. A raid? 19.99
2017-10-04 16:49:56	Perosa	and if you don't have it you are locked out of everyone's game that has them
2017-10-04 16:50:21	Doc_Mod	No no it gets better
2017-10-04 16:50:23	Perosa	that's also a huge step back. Public events are supposed to be things players do together randomly. Instead they have 5 million instances so every player can do their own public event alone!
