2017-10-02 15:40:04	Hierophant	In this manner, the approaching deadline (the pressure) motivates me to sit down and invest the 5 hours into completing the task and does not lead to half-assing of the task itself.

2017-10-04 14:53:46	Megafire	This seems a little weird to me, even by RPS standards.
2017-10-04 14:54:22	Aliphant	hm? what's wrong with it?
2017-10-04 14:54:47	Perosa	Aliphant: apparently now the word "gameplay" is a buzzword and it shouldn't be relevant when making games
2017-10-04 14:55:01	Perosa	aka. let's make every game a walking simulator, I guess?
2017-10-04 14:55:10	Aliphant	?!
2017-10-04 14:55:14	Aliphant	I wish there were more walking simulators though
2017-10-04 14:55:33	Aliphant	The only good walking simulator has been so thoroughly demonized and flamed :(
2017-10-04 14:55:37	Aliphant	Okay, there's that music-generated walking simulator whose name starts with a P and escapes me
2017-10-04 14:55:41	Aliphant	but it's just that and NMS
2017-10-04 14:55:58	Perosa	there's more than enough, the point is when they're crusading against games that aren't meant to appeal to them... and demand developers make them appeal to them?
2017-10-04 14:56:01	Perosa	that's ridiculously stupid
2017-10-04 14:56:50	Aliphant	I'll steelman them for a bit and say it's a crusade against the attitude that you need 50 new mechanics every game
2017-10-04 14:57:01	Perosa	no
2017-10-04 14:57:10	Aliphant	And that games like VNs or walking simulators are inherently inferior because they don't involve a billion mechanics 
2017-10-04 14:57:10	Perosa	that's definitely not it
2017-10-04 14:57:11	Perosa	that's most certainly not it
2017-10-04 14:57:44	Perosa	this is "i don't want to play the game, remove boss fights".
2017-10-04 14:59:31	Hex	Walking simulators are, in fact, not video games.
2017-10-04 14:59:46	Hex	They're shitty movies.
2017-10-04 14:59:49	Hex	That fail to evoke any emotion at all in me beyond "Man, I miss King's Quest."
2017-10-04 15:00:13	Hex	Wow look at our shitty puzzle it'll take you two, even THREE minutes to finish it
2017-10-04 15:00:37	Perosa	they lack "gameplay", they're a valid form to tell a story, but I'm not going to accept people who want things to be made easier for them because they're bad at their jobs
2017-10-04 15:01:17	Perosa	"boo-hoo, I couldn't play Cuphead through because I don't get the endings unless I play it in normal mode, let me skip boss fights." what the fuck
2017-10-04 15:01:17	Hex	Also, they're all arguing for it because of the new AC game, which right pisses me off - because the new AC game has an actual interesting mode based around having no gameplay.
2017-10-04 15:01:31	Hex	It's an educational exploration of Ancient Egypt, and Ubisoft actually researches the worlds they design around these games.
2017-10-04 15:01:32	Perosa	learning history mode, right?
2017-10-04 15:02:07	Hex	That's really cool and interesting to do - especially because if people use it, they'll start doing it for other games with less well-known historical backgrounds.
2017-10-04 15:03:18	Perosa	i dig how much work Ubisoft can put into that stuff
2017-10-04 15:03:18	Perosa	but they're two for 200 in good PC ports

2017-10-04 15:04:13	Perosa	i liked Black Flag :(
2017-10-04 15:04:14	Hex	In any case, I find it super fucking funny that the people who say this also want games to be art.
2017-10-04 15:04:33	Perosa	they should've made a pirate action RPG instead of Pyramid Climber
2017-10-04 15:04:35	Hex	Clearly, games can't be art if you don't understand that art sometimes isn't understood by everyone.
2017-10-04 15:04:59	tubes	black flag was great
2017-10-04 15:04:59	tubes	i liked the idea of syndicate

2017-10-04 15:05:05	tubes	but i loaded it up and realized it was just item collection  simulator
2017-10-04 15:05:18	Hex	I'm pretty sure it's about the Illuminati or something, dude was nuts.
2017-10-04 15:05:58	@Teruzi	I liked the boat fighting
2017-10-04 15:06:10	@Teruzi	Specially the legendary ship fights
2017-10-04 15:06:32	@Teruzi	the one with the two big ass boats at the same time was so good
2017-10-04 15:06:34	Hex	Black Flag is good, but Ubisoft is incredibly good at making bad games.
2017-10-04 15:06:43	Hex	It's impressive.
2017-10-04 15:06:49	Perosa	haha, Hex 
2017-10-04 15:07:17	Perosa	remember when they announced Beyond Good and Evil 2
2017-10-04 15:07:18	Perosa	and said it has seamless drop in multiplayer?
2017-10-04 15:07:18	Hex	I also remember when BGE2 was a prequel.
2017-10-04 15:07:18	Perosa	the cheers turned into silence so fast
2017-10-04 15:07:32	Hex	"We ended this game on a cliffhanger over A DECADE AGO, we should make a prequel to that game."

2017-10-04 16:19:30	Perosa	things to blame: Sony wanting a Ps4-focused competitive shooter? Probably not.
2017-10-04 16:19:47	Perosa	Activision? Likely. Bungie themselves? Less likely.

2017-10-04 16:21:46	Doc_Mod	I also remember Bungie being dead silent on the "ghost bullets" issue. Until like five major streamers started calling them out.
2017-10-04 16:22:08	Perosa	that was actually the issue iirc

2017-10-04 16:23:16	Hex	Video pops of him aiming dead on the head.
2017-10-04 16:24:36	Doc_Mod	Oh that reminds me
2017-10-04 16:24:45	Doc_Mod	Hey Bungie. Remember Custom Games? That big ass ROI feature?
2017-10-04 16:24:50	Doc_Mod	WHERE IS IT IN D2?
2017-10-04 16:24:55	Hex	It's hiding.
2017-10-04 16:25:03	Perosa	wait for the DLC :^)
2017-10-04 16:25:06	Perosa	do more strikes until then
2017-10-04 16:25:08	Perosa	oh but also
2017-10-04 16:25:13	Perosa	we removed all strike-unique gear
2017-10-04 16:25:21	Hex	Even my cloak of taniks?!
2017-10-04 16:25:23	Perosa	and strikes take 4 times as long as public events for worse loot
2017-10-04 16:25:38	Doc_Mod	Honestly I kind of don't mind that. As I never was one to spend 1,000 strikes grinding for the perfect Imago Loop.
2017-10-04 16:25:46	Doc_Mod	but I can understand the frustration of losing cool unique gear
2017-10-04 16:25:53	Perosa	Hex: yep
2017-10-04 16:25:53	Perosa	it's gone
2017-10-04 16:26:07	Hex	I like strikes.
2017-10-04 16:26:16	Hex	But I'm also an ex-raider.
2017-10-04 16:26:34	Perosa	see the thing is, Doc_Mod 
2017-10-04 16:26:39	Perosa	they removed random perks on loot
2017-10-04 16:26:47	Perosa	but they also have a fraction of the original loot available
2017-10-04 16:26:52	Perosa	and most of it is re-colors 
2017-10-04 16:27:21	Doc_Mod	Yeah. That makes part of the grind pointless. Because Once I get one "StarKiller 9000" I can shard all the others.
2017-10-04 16:28:22	Perosa	exactly the issue lots of people have
2017-10-04 16:28:42	Perosa	they removed unique loot and made the grind useless, but there's not enough loot to actually play a lot without grind
2017-10-04 16:28:59	Perosa	also they made mobility the most useless stat, and hunters the most useless class
2017-10-04 16:29:12	Perosa	because a warlock is faster than hunters
2017-10-04 16:29:23	Doc_Mod	Yeah. I remember people called Hunters selfish until Night stalker
2017-10-04 16:29:32	Doc_Mod	Because Oh my god dat Tether
2017-10-04 16:29:44	Hex	I will be a glorious wizard.
2017-10-04 16:29:49	Hex	Because I was a hunter in all of D1.

2017-10-04 16:29:55	Doc_Mod	I will be a Warlock
2017-10-04 16:30:00	Doc_Mod	I love the design of them
2017-10-04 16:30:10	Doc_Mod	I even bought a Warlock figurine
2017-10-04 16:30:10	Doc_Mod	:D
2017-10-04 16:30:13	Hex	It's time to show my mechanical superiority over the plebs with my sickass coat and giant second grenade.
2017-10-04 16:30:42	Doc_Mod	-blinks behind you- "Nothin Personal Kid" -melees you from a football field away-
2017-10-04 16:30:54	Perosa	they really need to buff hunters
2017-10-04 16:31:05	Perosa	and make the gear less recolors because shaders are already there to recolor things!
2017-10-04 16:32:08	Doc_Mod	I remember that D1 had lot more loot looks. Even in year 1. Though that could be bias
2017-10-04 16:32:22	Perosa	year 1 didn't have more loot, but less recolors

2017-10-04 16:35:36	Perosa	if it's any consolation, Doc_Mod
2017-10-04 16:35:50	Perosa	the scene kiddies Dead Orbit will win every faction event 
2017-10-04 16:35:58	Perosa	so you can go full "nothing personel kid" when you start plaing
2017-10-04 16:36:00	Perosa	playing*
2017-10-04 16:36:37	Doc_Mod	I am so annoyed at that
2017-10-04 16:36:51	Doc_Mod	Ghaul could have just hooked up a nuke with "Scan for Free exotics" written on it
2017-10-04 16:37:00	Doc_Mod	and he'd kill half our guardians with that alone
2017-10-04 16:37:04	Perosa	hahaha
