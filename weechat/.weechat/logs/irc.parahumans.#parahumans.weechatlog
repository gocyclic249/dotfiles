2017-10-02 15:40:04	Hierophant	In this manner, the approaching deadline (the pressure) motivates me to sit down and invest the 5 hours into completing the task and does not lead to half-assing of the task itself.

2017-10-04 14:53:46	Megafire	This seems a little weird to me, even by RPS standards.
2017-10-04 14:54:22	Aliphant	hm? what's wrong with it?
2017-10-04 14:54:47	Perosa	Aliphant: apparently now the word "gameplay" is a buzzword and it shouldn't be relevant when making games
2017-10-04 14:55:01	Perosa	aka. let's make every game a walking simulator, I guess?
2017-10-04 14:55:10	Aliphant	?!
2017-10-04 14:55:14	Aliphant	I wish there were more walking simulators though
2017-10-04 14:55:33	Aliphant	The only good walking simulator has been so thoroughly demonized and flamed :(
2017-10-04 14:55:37	Aliphant	Okay, there's that music-generated walking simulator whose name starts with a P and escapes me
2017-10-04 14:55:41	Aliphant	but it's just that and NMS
2017-10-04 14:55:58	Perosa	there's more than enough, the point is when they're crusading against games that aren't meant to appeal to them... and demand developers make them appeal to them?
2017-10-04 14:56:01	Perosa	that's ridiculously stupid
2017-10-04 14:56:50	Aliphant	I'll steelman them for a bit and say it's a crusade against the attitude that you need 50 new mechanics every game
2017-10-04 14:57:01	Perosa	no
2017-10-04 14:57:10	Aliphant	And that games like VNs or walking simulators are inherently inferior because they don't involve a billion mechanics 
2017-10-04 14:57:10	Perosa	that's definitely not it
2017-10-04 14:57:11	Perosa	that's most certainly not it
2017-10-04 14:57:44	Perosa	this is "i don't want to play the game, remove boss fights".
2017-10-04 14:59:31	Hex	Walking simulators are, in fact, not video games.
2017-10-04 14:59:46	Hex	They're shitty movies.
2017-10-04 14:59:49	Hex	That fail to evoke any emotion at all in me beyond "Man, I miss King's Quest."
2017-10-04 15:00:13	Hex	Wow look at our shitty puzzle it'll take you two, even THREE minutes to finish it
2017-10-04 15:00:37	Perosa	they lack "gameplay", they're a valid form to tell a story, but I'm not going to accept people who want things to be made easier for them because they're bad at their jobs
2017-10-04 15:01:17	Perosa	"boo-hoo, I couldn't play Cuphead through because I don't get the endings unless I play it in normal mode, let me skip boss fights." what the fuck
2017-10-04 15:01:17	Hex	Also, they're all arguing for it because of the new AC game, which right pisses me off - because the new AC game has an actual interesting mode based around having no gameplay.
2017-10-04 15:01:31	Hex	It's an educational exploration of Ancient Egypt, and Ubisoft actually researches the worlds they design around these games.
2017-10-04 15:01:32	Perosa	learning history mode, right?
2017-10-04 15:02:07	Hex	That's really cool and interesting to do - especially because if people use it, they'll start doing it for other games with less well-known historical backgrounds.
2017-10-04 15:03:18	Perosa	i dig how much work Ubisoft can put into that stuff
2017-10-04 15:03:18	Perosa	but they're two for 200 in good PC ports

2017-10-04 15:04:13	Perosa	i liked Black Flag :(
2017-10-04 15:04:14	Hex	In any case, I find it super fucking funny that the people who say this also want games to be art.
2017-10-04 15:04:33	Perosa	they should've made a pirate action RPG instead of Pyramid Climber
2017-10-04 15:04:35	Hex	Clearly, games can't be art if you don't understand that art sometimes isn't understood by everyone.
2017-10-04 15:04:59	tubes	black flag was great
2017-10-04 15:04:59	tubes	i liked the idea of syndicate

2017-10-04 15:05:18	Hex	I'm pretty sure it's about the Illuminati or something, dude was nuts.
2017-10-04 15:05:58	@Teruzi	I liked the boat fighting
2017-10-04 15:06:10	@Teruzi	Specially the legendary ship fights
2017-10-04 15:06:32	@Teruzi	the one with the two big ass boats at the same time was so good
2017-10-04 15:06:34	Hex	Black Flag is good, but Ubisoft is incredibly good at making bad games.
2017-10-04 15:06:43	Hex	It's impressive.
2017-10-04 15:06:49	Perosa	haha, Hex 
2017-10-04 15:07:17	Perosa	remember when they announced Beyond Good and Evil 2
2017-10-04 15:07:18	Perosa	and said it has seamless drop in multiplayer?
2017-10-04 15:07:18	Hex	I also remember when BGE2 was a prequel.
2017-10-04 15:07:18	Perosa	the cheers turned into silence so fast
2017-10-04 15:07:32	Hex	"We ended this game on a cliffhanger over A DECADE AGO, we should make a prequel to that game."

2017-10-04 16:19:30	Perosa	things to blame: Sony wanting a Ps4-focused competitive shooter? Probably not.
2017-10-04 16:19:47	Perosa	Activision? Likely. Bungie themselves? Less likely.

2017-10-04 16:21:46	Doc_Mod	I also remember Bungie being dead silent on the "ghost bullets" issue. Until like five major streamers started calling them out.

2017-10-04 16:24:45	Doc_Mod	Hey Bungie. Remember Custom Games? That big ass ROI feature?
2017-10-04 16:24:50	Doc_Mod	WHERE IS IT IN D2?
2017-10-04 16:24:55	Hex	It's hiding.
2017-10-04 16:25:03	Perosa	wait for the DLC :^)
2017-10-04 16:25:06	Perosa	do more strikes until then
2017-10-04 16:25:08	Perosa	oh but also
2017-10-04 16:25:13	Perosa	we removed all strike-unique gear
2017-10-04 16:25:21	Hex	Even my cloak of taniks?!
2017-10-04 16:25:23	Perosa	and strikes take 4 times as long as public events for worse loot
2017-10-04 16:25:38	Doc_Mod	Honestly I kind of don't mind that. As I never was one to spend 1,000 strikes grinding for the perfect Imago Loop.
2017-10-04 16:25:46	Doc_Mod	but I can understand the frustration of losing cool unique gear
2017-10-04 16:25:53	Perosa	Hex: yep
2017-10-04 16:25:53	Perosa	it's gone
2017-10-04 16:26:07	Hex	I like strikes.
2017-10-04 16:26:16	Hex	But I'm also an ex-raider.
2017-10-04 16:26:34	Perosa	see the thing is, Doc_Mod 
2017-10-04 16:26:39	Perosa	they removed random perks on loot
2017-10-04 16:26:47	Perosa	but they also have a fraction of the original loot available
2017-10-04 16:26:52	Perosa	and most of it is re-colors 
2017-10-04 16:27:21	Doc_Mod	Yeah. That makes part of the grind pointless. Because Once I get one "StarKiller 9000" I can shard all the others.
2017-10-04 16:28:22	Perosa	exactly the issue lots of people have
2017-10-04 16:28:42	Perosa	they removed unique loot and made the grind useless, but there's not enough loot to actually play a lot without grind
2017-10-04 16:28:59	Perosa	also they made mobility the most useless stat, and hunters the most useless class
2017-10-04 16:29:12	Perosa	because a warlock is faster than hunters
2017-10-04 16:29:23	Doc_Mod	Yeah. I remember people called Hunters selfish until Night stalker
2017-10-04 16:29:32	Doc_Mod	Because Oh my god dat Tether
2017-10-04 16:29:44	Hex	I will be a glorious wizard.

2017-10-04 16:30:54	Perosa	they really need to buff hunters
2017-10-04 16:31:05	Perosa	and make the gear less recolors because shaders are already there to recolor things!
2017-10-04 16:32:08	Doc_Mod	I remember that D1 had lot more loot looks. Even in year 1. Though that could be bias
2017-10-04 16:32:22	Perosa	year 1 didn't have more loot, but less recolors

2017-10-04 16:36:37	Doc_Mod	I am so annoyed at that
2017-10-04 16:36:51	Doc_Mod	Ghaul could have just hooked up a nuke with "Scan for Free exotics" written on it
2017-10-04 16:37:00	Doc_Mod	and he'd kill half our guardians with that alone
2017-10-04 16:37:04	Perosa	hahaha
2017-10-04 16:37:22	Perosa	Cayde does that.
2017-10-04 16:37:45	Perosa	There's a bug... uh, intended feature where a Cayde box spawns near an edge with a super fickle kill volume
2017-10-04 16:37:52	Perosa	so when you open it, it kills you
2017-10-04 16:37:58	Doc_Mod	Lel. 
2017-10-04 16:38:01	Doc_Mod	Oh Cayde
2017-10-04 16:39:07	Doc_Mod	I still don't get why they keep him around. He just irks me. 
2017-10-04 16:39:24	Perosa	he became a meme
2017-10-04 16:40:06	Hex	He's the only named character in the class leaders with any personality.
2017-10-04 16:40:22	Perosa	also he became a meme
2017-10-04 16:41:17	Doc_Mod	He's popular and marketable which means Cayde is invincible. 
2017-10-04 16:41:37	Doc_Mod	and Bungie is tired after working "so" hard on Ikora and Vuvuzela so they'll never get replaced either.
2017-10-04 16:42:50	Perosa	the actual issue is that he hit off with the casual player base and they'll make him the major character of every DLC because they don't have the writers to actually make every character a personality to remember
2017-10-04 16:43:15	Perosa	here's a list of characters people remember in Destiny 2: Ghaul, Cayde, Shaxx. 
2017-10-04 16:43:16	Perosa	that's it
2017-10-04 16:43:43	Perosa	oh also Xur every Friday.
2017-10-04 16:44:00	Hex	Oh, Shaxx.
2017-10-04 16:44:00	Hex	Yeah I remember him because I played a lot of PvP.
2017-10-04 16:44:19	Doc_Mod	"FIGHT FOREEEEVVER GUARDIAN! -feedback squeals-"
2017-10-04 16:45:15	Perosa	and well
2017-10-04 16:45:17	Perosa	they ruined Xur
2017-10-04 16:45:23	Doc_Mod	O rly
2017-10-04 16:45:24	Doc_Mod	How so?
2017-10-04 16:45:30	Doc_Mod	How did they ruin my lovely tentacles.
2017-10-04 16:45:51	Perosa	to quote a Forbes article: "Xur used to sell a number of things besides just exotics, legacy engrams, exotic shards, ammo synths, three of coins weapon ornament bundles, whatever those things were that changed the color of your ship/sparrow trail. Now he has none of that. Eververse has taken over anything remotely cosmetic. The game doesn’t need ammo synths, three of coins or exotic shards anymore (thank god), and that leaves
2017-10-04 16:45:51	Perosa	just…four exotics, every week."
2017-10-04 16:46:59	Doc_Mod	Yeah. I can see why People say D2 is a step forward and a step back.
2017-10-04 16:48:04	Perosa	hyped for Destiny 2 in 2020 being an awesome game, Doc_Mod? :P
2017-10-04 16:48:35	Doc_Mod	Yeah I can't wait for Destiny 2: The Darkness Regent in 2020
2017-10-04 16:48:51	Doc_Mod	Then Destiny 3 goes full circle and is just like Destiny 1 all over again
2017-10-04 16:49:15	Perosa	Destiny 3: Destiny No More
2017-10-04 16:49:26	Doc_Mod	Destiny 3: Make your own game
2017-10-04 16:49:37	Doc_Mod	With micro DLC from eververse
2017-10-04 16:49:52	Doc_Mod	Want a campaign mission? 3.99. A raid? 19.99
2017-10-04 16:49:56	Perosa	and if you don't have it you are locked out of everyone's game that has them
2017-10-04 16:50:21	Doc_Mod	No no it gets better
2017-10-04 16:50:23	Perosa	that's also a huge step back. Public events are supposed to be things players do together randomly. Instead they have 5 million instances so every player can do their own public event alone!

2017-10-05 17:06:03	Perosa	they took the "magic" out of "space magic"

2017-10-05 17:07:02	JENTHULHU	like, a lot of this stuff, like, "No Gunsmith Weapons" are things most people I'd ask would probably say they're glad it's gone because gunsmith weapons were tedious bullshit
2017-10-05 17:07:37	Perosa	they don't have the right amount of loot to take away random perks, most of the armors are re-colors, there is no strike specific loot and strikes take four times the time that a public event takes

2017-10-05 17:10:47	Doc_Mod	Though I do feel bungie dropped the ball hard on some exotics
2017-10-05 17:11:03	Doc_Mod	the Fighting Lion and Feedback Fence are fucking trash that should never have been put into the game
2017-10-05 17:11:18	Perosa	if only crucible was competitive, their connection based matchmaking is about as good as Ubisoft's For Honor P2P mess
2017-10-05 17:11:58	Doc_Mod	Now now. Bungie isn't that bad.

2017-10-05 17:12:51	Perosa	Bungie is just as bad <.<
2017-10-05 17:12:56	JENTHULHU	also the crucible playlist thing is a consequence of a mix of complacent gaming syndrome and the almighty altar of the k/d spread
2017-10-05 17:13:13	Ereus	doc_mod OH MY GOODNESS
2017-10-05 17:13:15	Perosa	is that his natural chin, Ereus

2017-10-05 17:13:33	Ereus	i doubt it, but if it is... good god
2017-10-05 17:13:51	JENTHULHU	like, one of the things that disgusts me the most in terms of modern shooters is the idea of objective-based games where players /still/ get points for killing the opposing team members
2017-10-05 17:14:17	Doc_Mod	I remember it was novel when Bungie made a game mode where kills didn't get points
2017-10-05 17:14:41	Ereus	yeah perosa checked, its a prosthetic
2017-10-05 17:15:11	Perosa	i read a post that had a really great PvEvP idea for PvP mode, Doc_Mod
2017-10-05 17:15:11	Ereus	but stilla great cospaly
2017-10-05 17:15:11	Jyggalag	banjo why
2017-10-05 17:15:11	JENTHULHU	Doc_Mod: sadly from what I understand such modes were trimmed away because people stopped playing because they only cared about their k/d spread after a certain point
2017-10-05 17:15:13	Perosa	where you get points for scoring the biggest kills on the field instead of killing enemies, though that'd stop them from getting points while they respawn
2017-10-05 17:16:03	Doc_Mod	IIRC. The new control tries to work with this by making it so the more zones you control the more points you get per kill/over time

2017-10-05 17:21:00	Perosa	that's actually likely 
2017-10-05 17:21:22	Perosa	player numbers for Destiny 2 go down as numbers for Destiny 1 go up again, especially on Xbox now that they actually have tons of loot again
2017-10-05 17:21:51	Perosa	it's not huge right now, but Destiny 2 won't have much of a lifespan if they don't add more content before the DLC drops

2017-10-05 17:25:50	JENTHULHU	...
2017-10-05 17:25:52	Perosa	i don't think they're actually considering any feedback and are just shrugging at everything, telling everyone to play more strikes that are worth nil.
2017-10-05 17:26:00	JENTHULHU	by which I mean it's what they've been doing?
2017-10-05 17:26:18	JENTHULHU	like, each week has had something new or such roll out, more or less
2017-10-05 17:26:25	Perosa	it's not enough to keep the game alive forever, they need some major changes to keep the dedicated player base that wants all of Destiny 1's improvements back

2017-10-05 17:32:40	Perosa	just make that a unique passive perk that requires no points. "double damage warlock lol"

2017-10-05 19:28:01	JustLurking	malwarebytes?
2017-10-05 19:28:15	Doc_Mod	I've heard good stuff about them too
2017-10-05 19:28:15	JustLurking	or whatever that's called?
2017-10-05 19:28:35	Rhet	I believe the active version is paid
2017-10-05 19:28:47	Perosa	it only has live protection for a month or so, JustLurking, but if you run it regularily it shouldn't be an issue
2017-10-05 19:28:55	JustLurking	Got it
2017-10-05 19:29:04	JustLurking	What's WinRar for again
2017-10-05 19:29:19	JustLurking	?
2017-10-05 19:29:20	ixi	Zip files.
2017-10-05 19:29:20	Perosa	just use 7zip
2017-10-05 19:29:20	ixi	Also, I don't have any AV on my computers. Yolo.
2017-10-05 19:29:36	Perosa	who even uses winrar anymore
2017-10-05 19:29:37	ThalAI	Use 7zip. Malwarebytes needs the paid version to do passive checking.
2017-10-05 19:29:37	Rhet	ixi: Oh, I wouldn't need any of that
2017-10-05 19:29:37	ixi	People who paid.
2017-10-05 19:29:42	⚡	Rhet backflips onto motorcycle
2017-10-05 19:29:48	ThalAI	I use Panda free.
2017-10-05 19:29:48	Rhet	I run linux
2017-10-05 19:30:12	Doc_Mod	Winrar makes money off of buisnesses who have to pay for it
2017-10-05 19:30:16	ixi	I only use ChromeOS.
2017-10-05 19:30:37	Doc_Mod	Ew.
2017-10-05 19:31:18	Ereus	doc_mod you know of toddposting right?
2017-10-05 19:31:19	Doc_Mod	no
2017-10-05 19:31:26	Doc_Mod	I am not knee deep in the meme mud
2017-10-05 19:31:30	Perosa	Ereus your obsession with memes has to stop
2017-10-05 19:31:39	Ereus	perosa but they are the dna of the soul
2017-10-05 19:31:39	ixi	Justlurking: just use ninite and choose what you want.
2017-10-05 19:31:41	ixi	Makes it easy.
2017-10-05 19:32:03	Ereus	doc_mod its when someone posts a pic of todd howard disguised trying to make people uy skyrim
2017-10-05 19:33:40	JustLurking	I'll do so, ixi.
2017-10-05 19:35:03	JustLurking	I hate the fact that I'm versed with mac; I don't know much about anything PC.

2017-10-05 19:36:59	JustLurking	Windows 10 Pro
2017-10-05 19:37:11	Perosa	that'd have been my second guess
2017-10-05 19:37:30	ThalAI	Perosa: but why
2017-10-05 19:37:34	Perosa	why what?
2017-10-05 19:38:02	Fulvus	They probably just haven't upgraded their computers.
2017-10-05 19:38:13	Fulvus	Window 7 best iteration.

2017-10-05 19:38:35	JENTHULHU	what did I come back to?

2017-10-05 19:38:57	JustLurking	Me asking how to computer.
2017-10-05 19:38:57	ixi	So Per's company should update to 7 in April.

2017-10-05 19:41:31	ixi	You're on Windows now JL, time to learn VB.net.
2017-10-05 19:41:52	Doc_Mod	Just Lurking just wait until you start learning Kerboscript
2017-10-05 19:41:52	Doc_Mod	Not yet JL

2017-10-05 19:42:03	Doc_Mod	Doc_Friend bought Lurk_Friend XCOM2
2017-10-05 19:42:24	JustLurking	Uh I think that's in german.
2017-10-05 19:42:38	JustLurking	I can understand most of it, but...
2017-10-05 19:42:47	Perosa	hummm
2017-10-05 19:43:03	Perosa	well if you're into it, Wolfenstein The New Colossus sounds like a great gift to ask for :P
2017-10-05 19:43:18	Perosa	what's more fun than shooting cyborg nazis?
2017-10-05 19:43:33	ixi	Shooting Demons.
2017-10-05 19:43:46	Doc_Mod	FYI: Kerboscript is a in game programming language someone made so you can code rockets like NASA does
2017-10-05 19:43:53	Perosa	Doom is great but it doesn't have the substance that Wolfenstein has nowadays
2017-10-05 19:46:10	ixi	But shooting demons is more fun than cyborg nazis.
2017-10-05 19:46:30	--	Faustus is now known as Faustsick
2017-10-05 19:47:15	ixi	I've shot so many iterations of nazis in games. Cyborg nazis, zombie nazis, space nazis, what's next?

2017-10-05 19:48:41	Perosa	old Bioware Worm game where Kaiser is the final boss
2017-10-05 19:49:52	jerbear94	That doesnt sound....... Half bad
2017-10-05 19:51:05	m1el	you get to shoot Kaiser. in his ball.
2017-10-05 19:51:24	Doc_Mod	Sniper Elite 7 :Battlefields of Earth Bet?

2017-10-05 19:53:32	Perosa	...
2017-10-05 19:53:35	Doc_Mod	Lol. This is giving me flash backs to SWAT4
2017-10-05 19:53:36	Perosa	Doc_Mod: actually, Rainbow Six: PRT, sounds like an interesting PvE or PvP SWAT4 style game idea
2017-10-05 19:53:39	Perosa	broooo
2017-10-05 19:53:42	Doc_Mod	AAAYYYYYYY
2017-10-05 19:53:45	Doc_Mod	"You're in my way sir"
2017-10-05 19:53:45	⚡	Perosa high fives Doc_Mod
2017-10-05 19:54:27	Perosa	play a squad of four PRT officers dealing with a parahuman threat, who wouldn't want to play that?
2017-10-05 19:55:09	m1el	X-Worm: PRT
2017-10-05 19:55:50	Doc_Mod	I have no idea perosa
2017-10-05 19:55:57	jerbear94	Everyone would bitch because they wanted to be the Parahuman lol
2017-10-05 19:56:18	Perosa	in case of PvP you could have one player be the parahuman, like in Dead by Daylight
2017-10-05 19:56:39	Perosa	but don't let the guys who did Evolve make such a game
2017-10-05 19:56:42	Doc_Mod	Makes me think of the game The Hidden
2017-10-05 19:57:07	Doc_Mod	One person is a superpowered invisible murderer and the rest are the doodz tasked with shooting it in the face
2017-10-05 19:57:08	Perosa	and well
2017-10-05 19:57:13	Perosa	otherwise any PRT style game I can imagine would just be
2017-10-05 19:57:17	jerbear94	I don't know why but I'm thinking MMO like City of Heroes but.. Ya know, better. 
2017-10-05 19:57:19	Perosa	imagine we had someone make an Xcom 2 mod
2017-10-05 19:57:24	ixi	Wow, The Hidden is so niche.
2017-10-05 19:57:33	ixi	I can't believe I've heard of it again.
2017-10-05 19:57:38	Perosa	where all aliens are replaced with parahumans and you deal with them as PRT
2017-10-05 19:58:24	Perosa	if you fail too many missions in certain cities you end up losing the city and a bunch of funding due to HOSV
2017-10-05 19:58:44	ixi	Right in front of a parahuman. Foam at the ready. Aim ... 45% chance to hit.
2017-10-05 19:59:15	jerbear94	(Not a mover either)
2017-10-05 19:59:41	JustLurking	I might get back in CS:GO...
2017-10-05 19:59:45	Perosa	boss fight for PRT ENE
2017-10-05 19:59:53	Perosa	the PRT vs. one undersider
2017-10-05 19:59:55	Perosa	no heroes available
2017-10-05 20:00:36	Perosa	why aren't there cool modding-capable people in the Worm fandom who could do this mod for us? :P
2017-10-05 20:00:47	Doc_Mod	Because being an idea guy is easy. Modding is hard work
2017-10-05 20:00:54	Perosa	true
2017-10-05 20:00:58	Doc_Mod	This would be a total conversion mod essentially
2017-10-05 20:01:09	Perosa	but total conversion worth it
2017-10-05 20:01:16	Perosa	i should've left it at totally worth it
2017-10-05 20:01:19	Perosa	i'm so uncool
2017-10-05 20:01:20	Perosa	i'm so lame
2017-10-05 20:01:32	Rhet	same
2017-10-05 20:02:36	Netrunner	Hey guys!
2017-10-05 20:02:37	Perosa	ahhh it's so easy coming up with stuff for this
2017-10-05 20:02:48	Perosa	using actual guns makes missions super easy but villains start escalating
2017-10-05 20:02:56	Perosa	they also bring guns with them
2017-10-05 20:03:10	ixi	Why don't you try your hand at it Doc? Iirc, it's Unreal 3.5 SDK.
2017-10-05 20:04:20	Doc_Mod	Because I don't have the drive to throw myself into coding and such for the project. I'm not that passionate about our illustrious PRT.
